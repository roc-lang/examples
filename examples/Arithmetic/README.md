# Arithmetic

A Roc program which accepts two integers from the command line and prints their sum, difference, product, quotient, remainder, and exponentiation.
See the [safe math example](https://www.roc-lang.org/examples/SafeMath/README) if you don't want your program to crash on e.g. a division by zero.

## Code
```roc
file:main.roc
```

## Output

Run this from the directory that has `main.roc` in it:

```
$ roc main.roc -- 20 4
sum: 24
difference: 16
product: 80
integer quotient: 5
remainder: 0
exponentiation: 160000
```
