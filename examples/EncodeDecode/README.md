# Encoding & Decoding Abilities

An example for how to implement the builtin `Encoding` and `Decoding` abilities for an opaque type (`ItemKind`).

Implementing these abilities for an opaque type like `ItemKind`, enables it to be used seamlessly within other data structures.
This is useful when you would like to provide a custom mapping, such as in this example, between an integer and a [tag union](https://www.roc-lang.org/tutorial#tag-union-types).

## Implementation
```roc
file:main.roc:snippet:impl
```

## Demo
```roc
file:main.roc:snippet:demo
```

## Output

Run this from the directory that has `main.roc` in it:

```
$ roc dev
(@ItemKind Text)
(@ItemKind Method)
(@ItemKind Function)
(@ItemKind Constructor)
(@ItemKind Field)
(@ItemKind Variable)
(@ItemKind Class)
(@ItemKind Interface)
(@ItemKind Module)
(@ItemKind Property)
```

You can also use `roc test` to run the tests.
