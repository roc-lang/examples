Here are some links to up to date Roc scripts used in the real world:
- [website build script](https://github.com/roc-lang/www.roc-lang.org/blob/main/website/build_website.roc)
- [CI script 1](https://github.com/roc-lang/basic-cli/blob/main/ci/check_all_exposed_funs_tested.roc) (uses basic-cli main branch)
- [CI script 2](https://github.com/roc-lang/basic-cli/blob/main/ci/check_cargo_versions_match.roc) (uses basic-cli main branch)

These scripts work well as examples to put in your LLM prompt.
