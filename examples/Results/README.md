# Results & Error Handling

TODO update this example with a snippet using the `try` keyword, see issue #227

This example shows how to use [`Result`](https://www.roc-lang.org/builtins/Result) in functions that can return errors. We will see how to use `Result.try` or the try operator `?` to chain functions and return the first error if any occurs.

## Code

```roc
file:main.roc
```

## Output

Run this from the directory that has `main.roc` in it:

```sh
roc examples/Results/main.roc
```
