# Pattern Matching on Lists

All the ways to pattern match on lists:
```roc
when input is
    [] -> EmptyList

    [_, ..] -> NonEmptyList

    ["Hi", ..] -> StartsWithHi

    [.., 42] -> EndsWith42

    [Foo, Bar, ..] -> StartsWithFooBar

    [Foo, Bar, Baz("Hi")] -> FooBarBazStr

    [Foo, Count(num), ..] if num > 0 -> FooCountIf

    [head, .. as tail] -> HeadAndTail(head, tail)

    _ -> Other
```
Note: this specific snippet would not typecheck because it uses lists of different types.
This is just meant to be a compact overview. See the code section below for valid Roc.

## Code
```roc
file:PatternMatching.roc
```

## Output

Run this from the directory that has `PatternMatching.roc` in it:

```
$ roc test PatternMatching.roc

0 failed and 8 passed in 88 ms.
```
